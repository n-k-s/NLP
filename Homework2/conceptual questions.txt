1.	The first problem generates so many long sentences because there are endless loops.
	NP leads into NP PP. PP also leads into another NP. The solution would be to weight non looping sentences heavier than looping sentences.
	If NP -> DT Noun was twice as likely as NP -> NP PP, the amount of long sentences would be less likely.
	
2.	There is at least 3 ways to construct that sentence. It follows the structure of NP -> NP PP which can loop into itself so you can have it branch
	down
	NP -> NP PP
		NP -> DT (Every) Noun (sandwich)
		PP -> Prep (with) NP  (break HERE)
			NP -> NP PP
				NP - > DT (a) Noun (pickle)
				PP -> prep (on) NP
					NP -> NP PP
						NP -> DT (th) Noun (floor)
						PP -> prep (under) NP
							NP -> DT(the) Noun(cheif of staff)
	the first way follows a branching structure where the left half leads to terminals and the right half keeps extending in the endless loop
	But you can also turn the NP into NP PP and turn that NP into another NP PP so you can change the structure and reach the same sentence with a different path
